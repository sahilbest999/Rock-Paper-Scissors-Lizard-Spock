This Game features two modes: Easy Mode and Hard Mode

Easy Mode is the old and boring Rock, Paper, Scissors while a new mode is the redefined version of the old one which has two new characters Lizard and Spock. You might be wondering "why such character names?"...well even i'm not sure but this Game was played on the famous show called "The Big Bang Theory", I highly recommend you to watch the show it's a great series

For reference check out this short clip of the episode where the game was played
